# news-explorer-api

## Features

The website have two main features:
  - [x] When the user enters a keyword in the search bar, the website sends a request to the News API service, find all the relevant articles over the last week, and display a list of cards for each of them.
  - [x] It displays all articles saved by a user in a special section of the website.
  
## Back-End

In this project, we worked with two APIs:
  * The News API, which returns JSON data containing headlines, bylines and other data from keyword searches.
  * An API for user authentication and saving articles on a server created independently.

## Infrastructure
  - Git 
  - Trello
  - Create React App
